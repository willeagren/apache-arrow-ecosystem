# The Apache Arrow Ecosystem Collection [WIP]
Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to process and move data fast. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. The project is developing a multi-language collection of libraries for solving systems problems related to in-memory analytical data processing. This includes such topics as:

> - Zero-copy shared memory and RPC-based data movement  
> - Reading and writing file formats (like CSV, Apache ORC, and Apache Parquet)  
> - In-memory analytics and query processing

The currently supported environments are:
- C/Glib
- C++
- C#
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- Julia
- MATLAB
- Python
- R
- Ruby
- Rust
